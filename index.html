{% capture billboard_description %}

A lightweight, comprehensive batch framework designed to enable the development of robust batch applications vital for the daily operations of enterprise systems. 

{% endcapture %}

{% capture main_content %}

Spring Batch provides reusable functions that are essential in processing large volumes of records, including logging/tracing, transaction management, job processing statistics, job restart, skip, and resource management. It also provides more advanced technical services and features that will enable extremely high-volume and high performance batch jobs through optimization and partitioning techniques. Simple as well as complex, high-volume batch jobs can leverage the framework in a highly scalable manner to process significant volumes of information.

## Features

* Transaction management
* Chunk based processing
* Declaritive I/O
* Start/Stop/Restart
* Rety/Skip
* Web based administration interface (Spring Batch Admin)

## Quick Start

{% include download_widget.md %}

The quickest way to get started with Spring Batch is to download the zip file and use one of the shell projects we provide.

## XML based configuration
1. Download the zip release from our repository: [Download](http://static.springsource.org/downloads/nightly/release-download.php?project=BATCH)
2. After unzipping the download, copy the /samples/spring-batch-simple-cli folder to your workspace.
3. From the root of you new project's directory, you can build the project via maven `mvn clean install`
4. From the project's target directory, you'll be able to run your new job (pipes a file into an in memory database table) via the command `java -jar spring-batch-simple-cli-2.2.1.RELEASE.jar launch-context.xml personJob`

## Java based configuration (3.0+)
1. Download the zip release from our repository: [Download](http://static.springsource.org/downloads/nightly/milestone-download.php?project=BATCH)
2. After unzipping the download, copy the /samples/spring-batch-simple-cli-javaconfig folder to your workspace.
3. From the root of you new project's directory, you can build the project via maven `mvn clean install`
4. From the project's target directory, you'll be able to run your new job (pipes a file into an in memory database table) via the command `java -jar spring-batch-simple-cli-3.0.0.M1.jar example.LaunchContext personJob`
