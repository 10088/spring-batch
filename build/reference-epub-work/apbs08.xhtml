    is run, it is common to create an archive strategy for the meta-data
    tables. The tables themselves are designed to show a record of what
    happened in the past, and generally won't affect the run of any job, with
    a couple of notable exceptions pertaining to restart:</p><div class="itemizedlist" epub:type="list"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem" epub:type="list-item"><p>The framework will use the meta-data tables to determine if a
        particular JobInstance has been run before. If it has been run, and
        the job is not restartable, then an exception will be thrown.</p></li><li class="listitem" epub:type="list-item"><p>If an entry for a JobInstance is removed without having
        completed successfully, the framework will think that the job is new,
        rather than a restart.</p></li><li class="listitem" epub:type="list-item"><p>If a job is restarted, the framework will use any data that has
        been persisted to the ExecutionContext to restore the Job's state.
        Therefore, removing any entries from this table for jobs that haven't
        completed successfully will prevent them from starting at the correct
        point if run again.</p></li></ul></div></section><footer/></body></html>
